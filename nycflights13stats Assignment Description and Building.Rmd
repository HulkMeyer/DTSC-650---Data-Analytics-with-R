```
The actual data set is called flights.
*See the nycflights13 package page and chapter 5 from the textbook for more info.
Round all float/dbl values to two decimal places.
*If your rounding does not work the way you expect, convert the tibble to a dataframe by using as.data.frame()
All statistics should be run with variables in the order I state
*E.g., “Run a regression predicting mileage from mpg, make, and type” would be: lm(mileage ~ mpg + make + type...)
```{r}
describe(flights)
```
Creating the data set that is outlined 
```{r}
flights_df <- as.data.frame(flights)
```

## Problem 1
Address the outliers for departure delay as described in the outliers lectures.  You'll want to create a ne dataset without outliers for use in Q2-5.  What percentage of data remains following the removal of these outliers?
* The answer should be assigned to Q1

Begin looking for outliers
```{r}
summary(flights_df)
```
```{r}
ggplot(flights_df) +
  geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(dep_delay))
```
```{r}
ggplot(flights_df) +
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x=dep_delay), binwidth = 0.50) +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 100))
```
Begin Refining the Data set
* Identify Upper and Lower Quartiles
```{r}
flights_upper <- quantile(flights_df$dep_delay, .9985, na.rm = TRUE)
flights_lower <- quantile(flights_df$dep_delay, .0015, na.rm = TRUE)
cat('Flights Upper Quartile = ', flights_upper, ' & ', 'Flights Lower Quartile = ', flights_lower)
```
WHat are the Outliers
```{r}
flights_out <- which(flights_df$dep_delay > flights_upper | flights_df$dep_delay < flights_lower)
```
Pulling out the Outliers
```{r}
flights_df_no_out <- flights_df[-flights_out,]
```
Percentage of original remaining
```{r}
Q1 <- round((nrow(flights_df) - length(flights_out))/ nrow(flights_df)*100,2)
Q1
```
#### This was Correct so we can more forward using -> flights_df_no_out

## Problem 2
Run cor.test for the relationship between departure delay and distance. 
  * Assign the results of the cor.test() function to Q2.  Do not round
```{r}
Q2 <- cor.test(flights_df_no_out$dep_delay, flights_df_no_out$distance)
Q2
```
## Problem 3
Create a regression predicting departure delay from distance.  
* The summary of the model should be assigned to Q3.  Do not round
##### Note: CodeGrade will be grading you based on the last two lines of the summary output
```{r}
reg_flights <- lm(flights_df_no_out$dep_delay ~ flights_df_no_out$distance, data = flights_df_no_out)
Q3 <- summary(reg_flights)
Q3
```

## Problem 4
Calculate standardized regression coefficients with lm.beta for the regression from Q3.
* Assign the results of lm.beta() to Q4. Do not round. 
```{r}
Q4 <- lm.beta(reg_flights)
Q4
```

## Problem 5
Create another regression, this time adding carrier as a predictor to the regression from Q3
* The summary of the model should be assigned to Q5. Do not Round
* Note: If you use a different method of removing outliers (see Q1) than what Dr. Longo uses in his videos you risk upsetting CodeGrade
* Note: CodeGrade will be grading you based on the last two lines of the summary output
```{r}
reg_flights2 <- lm(flights_df_no_out$dep_delay ~ flights_df_no_out$distance + flights_df_no_out$carrier, data = flights_df_no_out)
Q5 <- summary(reg_flights2)
Q5
