# fastfood Assignment Description
For this assignment, you must name your R file nycflights13.R
* For all questions you should load tidyverse and nycflights13.  You should not need to use any other libraries. 
  * If the tidyverse package is not installed, you’ll need to do a one-time installation from the Console Window in RStudio like this:
    install.packages("tidyverse")
    **You cannot attempt to install packages in code that you submit to CodeGrade. **
  * If the nycflights13 package is not installed, you’ll need to do a one-time installation from the Console Window in RStudio like this:
    install.packages("openintro")
    **You cannot attempt to install packages in code that you submit to CodeGrade.** 
  * Load tidyverse with: 
    **suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tidyverse))**
  * Load nycflights13 with:
    **suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(openintro))**
  * The actual data set is called flights.
    See the nycflights13 package page and chapter 5 from the textbook for more info.
* Round all float/dbl values to two decimal places.
  * If your rounding does not work the way you expect, convert the tibble to a dataframe by using as.data.frame()
* All statistics should be run with variables in the order I state
  * E.g., “Run a regression predicting mileage from mpg, make, and type” would be:
    **lm(mileage ~ mpg + make + type...)**
    
## Setting up packages
```{r warning=FALSE}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tidyverse))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(psych))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(openintro))
```
## Taking a look at the data
```{r}
data("fastfood")
fastfood <- openintro::fastfood
```
```{r}
psych::describe(fastfood)
summary(fastfood)
head(fastfood)
fastfood
```
## Problem 1
Looking only at Burger King and Chick-Fil-A, which item has the highest Calories?
  * THe answer may be a tibble or a dataframe.  Assign it to Q1. Only need the name of the item.
```{r}
Q1 <- fastfood %>%
  select(restaurant, item, calories) %>%
  filter(restaurant == 'Burger King' | restaurant == 'Chick Fil-A') %>%
  arrange(desc(calories)) %>%
  select(item) %>%
  head(1)
 
Q1
```
## Problem 2
What is the mean sugar amount for all items from Subway?
  * Assign the answer to Q2
```{r}
Q2 <- fastfood %>%
  select(restaurant, sugar) %>%
  filter(restaurant == 'Subway') %>%
  summarise(mean_sugar = round(mean(sugar), 2)) %>%
  as.data.frame()
  
Q2
```
### Problem 3
What is the mean value of calories for all items from Taco Bell?
  * Assign the answer to Q3
```{r}
Q3 <- fastfood %>%
  select(restaurant, calories) %>%
  filter(restaurant == 'Taco Bell') %>%
  summarise(mean_calories = round(mean(calories), 2)) %>%
  as.data.frame()
  
Q3
```
## Problem 4
Create a variable equal to total_fat x sugar called fatXsugar.  Produce a tibble that has the restaurant, item, and fatXsugar for the top 3 items, from highest to lowest. 
  * Your answer should be in a 3 X 3 tibble assigned to Q4.
```{r}
Q4 <- fastfood %>%
  mutate(fatXsugar = total_fat * sugar) %>%
  select(restaurant, item, fatXsugar) %>%
  arrange(desc(fatXsugar)) %>%
  head(3)
 
Q4
```
## Problem 5
How many restaurants have an average saturated fat over 10?
  * Your answer should be on integer assigned to Q5
```{r}
Q5 <- fastfood %>%
  group_by(restaurant) %>%
  summarise(avg_satfat = round(mean(sat_fat),2)) %>%
  filter(avg_satfat > 10) %>%
  nrow()

Q5
```
